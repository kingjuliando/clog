# Clog: Command Line blOG

A static site generator written in Perl. Posts written in markdown. 
URL's are formatted /posts/YYYY-mm-dd-title-of-post.html. It makes it really
nice to update a blog from the web server
command line.

## Benefits


~~- Simple and easy to use ~~
~~- Edit with vim and markdown ~~
~~- Fairly SEO friendly ~~
~~- Designed to be fast loading ~~
~~- Sensible CSS defaults ~~ 

- I didn't have to learn how to use someone else's
  static site generator (also, all of the above)


## Usage

Keep the script in the site root directory to make
things simple. 

`./clog add` add a new post 

`./clog publish` publish the post you added

`./clog update` update the index.html page 

`./clog updateall` updates every page on the site
(use this if you're updating the html or css elements in
the `src` folder)

`./clog rm` remove a post from posts/ 

`./clog setup` add a title and description to the
blog


## Todo

- [x] global update all function
- [ ] should be able to select a post to edit
- [ ] timestamp the edit of the post?
